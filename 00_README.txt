json_checker.php
PHP version of the JSON checker.
•	You will need to change the value of $url to your application's web path that 
contains your JSON APIs.
•	Or pass your application's web path as value for query parameter 'url' 
http://localhost/json_checker/json_checker.php?url=http://127.0.0.1/json_checker/json
•	Or, in command line, pass it as the first argument
C:\wamp64\www\json_checker\> php json_checker.php http://127.0.0.1/json_checker/json
        
testcases\
	in 
		Input for JSON API like name, password, isbn13 etc.
	Out 
		Your expected output
	Yours 
		Actual output generates by tested API
Note
•	Test is either pass if API’s output is the same as your expected output or 
fail otherwise.
•	You need to include a success authenticate in the test (authenticate.txt), 
json_checker will capture token generated by authenticate API for further test. For example, if you 
authenticate with apple.2016 user, the bootstrap test will fail due to token invalid (not admin token)  
•	Please use the same folder structure and file name convention to build your test 
•	To speed things up, you should remove bootstrap and test all other functions  
before it, because bootstrap can mess up your data and the upload process takes considerably 
more time to finish. Similarly, delete and modify should be test separately too. 
•	File name should be grouped into API group, for example 001-authenticate,  
002-authenticate … are for authenticate API, then 100-create,101-create is for create API. 
•	You do not need to test Bootstrap API now.
